Iâ€™m Tony, an undergraduate student at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), currently a visiting student in the [Soft and Micro Robotics Laboratory](https://smrl.mit.edu/) at [MIT](https://mit.edu/).

My research focuses on building advanced, robust robotic systems by integrating sensing and estimation, power electronics, and model-based/ data-driven control/optimization theory. My passion goes beyond constructing and controlling robots but also improving them through optimization methods, bio-inspriation, deep understanding of physics phenomena, driving toward more intelligent and powerful robots.

I am seeking PhD opportunities in Robotics in Fall 2025.
